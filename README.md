# Bingo

This is a project that was designed to test the use of new solutions such as Clerk and Drizzly. 
An application has been created where you need to create an account, here practically all the work is done by Clerk, 
which easily allows you to create users and then authenticate them. Once the account is created, the user has the option of 
generating a bingo card and replenishing it until they win. In this case, I decided to use Postgres connected to Vercel. 
This solution provided an easy way to use serverside components.
